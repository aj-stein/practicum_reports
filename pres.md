## The Problem

- Cloud computing infrastructure is essentially ubiquitous.
- Cloud service providers must cater to customers, especially regulated ones.
- A major barrier is ongoing evaluation of the providerâ€™s cybersecurity posture.
- The results are often centralized bureaucracies.

## The Problem

- Are these bureaucracies the right way?
- Are they the only way?
- Who watches the watchers?

---

## The Solution

- Analyze FedRAMP ConMon's strengths and weaknesses.
- Design an alternative model.
  - Stakeholders mutually monitor each other with transparency services.
  - Forgo control-driven assessment, focus measurable security properties.
  - Use a simple quantitative framework for measuring properties.
- Do not authorize, do not score, **only measure** _each other_.
