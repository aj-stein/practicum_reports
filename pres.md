# Mutual Monitoring Update

Progress Report 4

## Problem 

- Cloud service providers are everywhere, but their security is complex.
- Continuous monitoring is complex, tedious multi-party process.
    - FedRAMP is a very public example.
- Everything is manual.
- Information flows in one direction, not to everyone who needs it.
- Is there a better way?

---

## Solution

- Examine FedRAMP as a representative example.
- Re-imagine a new system with:
    - a new technological approach; and
    - change the process and how people interact.
- Estimate improved cost and performance.

## Solution Deliverables

:gift: :one: Critical analysis of FedRAMP
:gift: :two: Architecture specification
:gift: :three: <del>Prototype code for mutual monitoring transparency service</del>
:gift: :four: A quantitative cloud security measurement framework
:boom: :mag: Evaluation results

---

## Status

- :gift: :one: I completed the draft of FedRAMP's critical analysis.
- :gift: :two: I updated the architecture specification.
- :gift: :three: I wrapped up development on the transparency service, <del>removed it from final deliverables</del>.

---

## Status

- :gift: :four: I created a preliminary quantitative measurement framework for cloud security.
- :boom: :mag: I continued development on Monte Carlo methods for quantitative evaluation.
- :boom: :mag: I coded all FedRAMP 20x Working Group comments for qualitative evaluation.

## Challenges

- Deferring my favorite part of the project for later
- Consistently performing user experience interviews as designed

---

### Questions

1. I will interview stakeholders, what **must** I publish with the final paper?
    - interview methodology?
    - interview questions?
    - detailed (but properly redacted) interview notes?

--- 

### Next Weeks' Focus

- Final touches on:
  - :gift: :one: the critical analysis of FedRAMP
  - :gift: :two: the architecture specification  
- :boom: :mag: Complete user experience interviews
- :boom: :mag: Complete project evaluation
- :ship: :rocket: Start the final paper

---

## Feedback

- You can provide feedback in multiple ways.
- Post in the class discussion board in Canvas.
- Open issues in my GitHub repo at [github.com/aj-stein/practicum/issues](https://github.com/aj-stein/practicum/issues/new).
