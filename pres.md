# Mutual Monitoring Update

Progress Report 3

## Problem 

- Cloud service providers are everywhere, but their security is complex.
- Continuous monitoring is complex, tedious multi-party process.
    - FedRAMP is a very public example.
- Everything is manual.
- Information flows in one direction, not to everyone who needs it.
- Is there a better way?

---

## Solution

- Examine FedRAMP as a representative example.
- Re-imagine a new system with:
    - a new technological approach; and
    - change the process and how people interact.
- Estimate improved cost and performance.

## Solution Deliverables

:gift: :one: Critical analysis of FedRAMP
:gift: :two: Architecture specification
:gift: :three: :shrug: Prototype code for mutual monitoring transparency service :shrug:
:gift: :four: A quantitative cloud security measurement framework
:boom: :mag: Evaluation results

---

## Status

- :gift: :one: I completed more desk research and fleshed out my deliverables' outline.
- :gift: :two: I completed a full draft of architecture specification.
- :gift: :three: I had to quickly write scripts to dump all data from the FedRAMP modernization forum.
- :gift: :three: I worked on the critical analysis of FedRAMP to complete in the next day or so.
- :boom: :mag: Publish survey to request interviews with stakeholders for final evaluation.

---

## Status

- After less than 24 hours, nine legitimate (and one fake) volunteers.
- Current sample of volunteer has even distribution of relevant stakeholder backgrounds.
- Hopefully more to follow!

## Challenges

- Interpreting specs from other use cases for mutual monitoring
- Finding transparency service data
  - model resource requirements
  - compare model of transparency service for mutual monitoring use case
- Fake volunteers with profane names registering for evaluation interviews

---

### Questions

1. Can I deprioritize :gift: :three: the prototype & focus on :gift: :one: the specification?
1. I will interview stakeholders, what **must** I publish with the final paper?
    - interview methodology?
    - interview questions?
    - detailed (but properly redacted) interview notes?
1. How do I cite conversations in private Slack channels with developers that make transparency services, but for different use cases than mine?

--- 

### Next Weeks' Focus

1. :gift: :one: Finish FedRAMP critical analysis, get advisor feedback, polish.
1. :gift: :two: Update the architecture specification, pending advisor feedback
1. :gift: :three: :shrug: Reduce scope or stop prototype development. :shrug:
1. :gift: :four: :shrug: Create the quantitative cloud security measurement framework.
1. :gift: :dart: Finish outline of final paper, get ready for the end.

## Feedback

- You can provide feedback in multiple ways.
- Post in the class discussion board in Canvas.
- Open issues in my GitHub repo at [github.com/aj-stein/practicum/issues](https://github.com/aj-stein/practicum/issues/new).

## Conclusion

Et fin.

(See you all again in two weeks.)
